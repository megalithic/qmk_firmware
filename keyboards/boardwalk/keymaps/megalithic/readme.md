# Boardwalk 2u space + arrow keys

My customizations:

- I'm used to control being my caps-lock key on a standard keyboard, so I've
  got a LCTRL there.
- I use a hyper-key setup through hammerspoon, so I've got an F19 key to enable
  that.
- I use GUI+[1-5] for various OSX shortcuts (sketch, switching tabs, taking
  screenshots) so there's a secret layer for that.
- I am used to using both hands for mods, so I've got mods on both sides (hence
  the name fullmods)

## TODO

- Use the space bars as modifiers?
- Use the layer buttons as enter keys?
